## About me

I am a senior at Whitman College majoring in Economics with additional coursework in Data Science and Geology. My academic and professional interests focus on the energy transition space, renewable energy investments, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing. After graduation, I hope to build a career in asset management or investments, where I can contribute meaningfully to sustainable financial strategies and innovative solutions for a low-carbon world.
